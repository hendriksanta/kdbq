TradeImpacts: 
Quick introduction to the use of q in the context of trade flow analytics. We generate some dummy data and use q's as of
join to extract pre and post event data. The specific example looks at price changes pre/post trade, but the analysis and
construction of impact profiles can be used in any other context.  


ElegantAlgorithms:
A small collection of algorithms implemented with q - in some cases the particular syntax of q makes the implementation
surprisingly elegant.
